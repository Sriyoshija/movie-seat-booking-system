# Standalone Website - No Server Required! 🎉

I've created a **standalone version** of your website that works **without running any code**!

## 📍 Location

The standalone files are in:
```
d:\2YR 1SEM\KLH\PROJECTS\BEEC PROJECT\JAVA PROJECT\standalone\
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Super Simple Method:
1. Go to the `standalone` folder
2. **Double-click `index.html`**
3. Website opens in your browser!
4. **No server, no installation needed!**

### All Files Included:
- ✅ `index.html` - Login page
- ✅ `signup.html` - Registration
- ✅ `movies.html` - Movie selection
- ✅ `areas.html` - Area & showtime selection
- ✅ `seats.html` - Seat booking
- ✅ `admin.html` - Admin panel
- ✅ `app.js` - All functionality
- ✅ `styles.css` - Beautiful styling

## ✨ Features

Everything works exactly like the server version:
- ✅ Login/Signup
- ✅ Movie selection
- ✅ Area differentiation (different seat maps & pricing)
- ✅ Seat booking
- ✅ Admin panel (add/delete movies)
- ✅ Booking confirmations (shown in alert)
- ✅ Data persistence (saved in browser)

## 🔑 Test Accounts

**Admin:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Regular User:**
- Username: `user`
- Password: `user123`

## 💾 How It Works

- Uses **localStorage** to store all data in your browser
- No database needed
- No server needed
- Works completely offline
- Data persists between sessions

## 📧 Email Feature

Since there's no server, booking confirmations are:
- Shown in an alert popup
- Logged to browser console
- Saved to localStorage for history

## 🎯 Area Pricing

| Area | Seats | Price |
|------|-------|-------|
| Standard | 10x10 | $10/seat |
| Premium | 8x8 | $15/seat |
| VIP | 6x6 | $25/seat |
| Recliner | 5x5 | $30/seat |

## 📝 Notes

- Data is stored in your browser (localStorage)
- Each browser has separate data
- Clearing browser data will reset everything
- Works on any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

## 🎉 That's It!

Just open `index.html` and you're ready to go! No installation, no server setup, just open and use!

**Both versions available:**
1. **Server version** (Spring Boot) - Full features with real email
2. **Standalone version** - Works without any server, just open HTML file

Choose whichever works best for you! 🚀
